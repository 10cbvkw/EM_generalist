# EM generalist: A Physics-Driven Diffusion Foundation Model for Electron Microscopy

## Overview

EM generalist is a cutting-edge diffusion-based foundation model designed to revolutionize electron microscopy (EM) and volumetric EM (vEM) image processing. Our physics-driven approach leverages over 1.7 million EM/vEM images to provide zero-shot solutions for diverse imaging challenges.

## Key Features

✔ **Multi-task Solution**  
- Denoising
- 2D Super-resolution reconstruction
- Deblurring
- 3D isotropic volume reconstruction

✔ **Technical Advantages**  
- Zero-shot reconstruction (no paired training needed)
- A unified solution for all tasks
- A foundation model for omni-sample type scanning elecron microscopy (SEM) data
